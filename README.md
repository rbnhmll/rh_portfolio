# Robin Hamill Portfolio site
A personal portfolio site

	* Migrated from WordPress
	* Built on Rails

## To be worked on:
	* Fix nav: Smooth-scroll is not working. Might need different nav for Front-end/back-end to respect href="#anchor"
	* Create model for language taxonomy
		* Should allow any number of languages to be added
		* Loop over in view
