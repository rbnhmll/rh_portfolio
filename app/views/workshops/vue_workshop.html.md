## Get started with just the CDN

* Grab the CDN or download the .js file
* Setting up new Vue Instance
  * el
  * data (state)
  * methods
* Vue Directives (and arguments)
  * `v-if` (conditional rendering)
  * `v-for` (render loop)
  * `v-on` (event binding) [shortcut: `@`]
  * `v-model` (two-way data binding)
  * `v-bind` (attributes) [shortcut: `:`]
* Directive modifiers
  * `v-on:submit.prevent="onSubmit"`

## Using vue-cli (like create-react-app)

* Install vue-cli (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli), `$ npm install -g vue-cli`
* Create project
  `$ vue init <template-name> <project-name>`
* Start Server
  `$ npm run dev`
* Download example project `cli--COMPLETE`
* Vue plugin for Chrome and Firefox
* Style scoping (and SASS with node-sass)
  `$ npm install sass-loader node-sass --save-dev`
* Single File Components
* Props
* computed properties
* Lifecycle Hooks?
* Notes and Gotchas: [
  * In components, must use `data` as a function which returns an object, or it will not work
    ]

## Run with it!

Vue has a bunch of additional tools which parallel other popular frameworks

* Vuex (like Redux)
* Vue-router (like React-router)
* Nuxt.js (SSR)
